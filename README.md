This is a first mini game, a 2D labyrinth.

This project was written for and compiled on a Mac.
The program needs glfw and automatically downloads libmlx42. make or make bonus. Start with ./solong <map>, the maps are in the maps folder.

This project was a 42School project, we had to program according to a strict norm, for instance using only while loops, having only 25 lines per function etc.
