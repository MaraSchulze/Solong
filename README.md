# Solong
This is a first mini game, a 2D labyrinth.  
Smurf has to save Smurfette by collecting apples and avoiding the evil forest creatures.  
Use WASD as cursor keys.  

# Usage
This project was written for and compiled on a Mac.  
The program needs glfw and automatically downloads libmlx42.

make bonus
./solong maps/normalmap_bonus
```

## Caveats
This project was a 42School project, we had to program according to a strict norm, for instance using only while loops, having only 25 lines per function, not using inline comments etc.
